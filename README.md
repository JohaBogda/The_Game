## Approach

- viewed several different youtube videos for inspiration for games; chose a simpler one based on the fact that I knew I was facing less time and unreliable wifi throughout this week
- hand-drew a wire-frame for the layout with simple notes on how to create the elements
- started with a simple HTML & CSS
- once the ground work was done, began linking HTML to JS
- spent a lot of time overall reading up on new things like modals, using images, and the usage of prompts integrated into the site

  
## Road Blocks

1. unreliable/ limited wifi was the biggest issue 
2. amount of time spent stuck on simple things 
3. feeling lost & limited on ideas, basics, and knowledge 

  
## Improvements

- overall looks/ fill out the space on page
- add for the game to display the result of computer/earth so player knows who won
- add animations for during the game
